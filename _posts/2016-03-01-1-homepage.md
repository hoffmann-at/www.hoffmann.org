# Creativity & Innovation

Information and Communication Technologies have been one of the major drivers of innovation over the last decades. But do we understand how creativity and innovation work? Are computers replacing humans? Or can human creativity and innovation be enhanced by computing? And what is the best way for increasing innovation? Below are some of my contributions to answering these questions.

At the [Digital Architecture and Planning](http://www.iemar.tuwien.ac.at/) department and [Automation and Control Institute](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/) of [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/) I have worked on computational support for design. One of my conclusions from this effort is: Creativity needs to be free to break out of the box. So the computer system needs to offer options for relaxing control at some point in the process. There is also a [publication describing the prototype I have developed] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30870842_Tolerating_Inconsistencies_The_Distributed_Perspectives_Model)
